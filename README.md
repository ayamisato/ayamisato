- 👋 Hi, I’m @ayamisato
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to be a full stack coder and eventually an embedded software engineer and hope to work in F1!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning EVERYTHING. I have no background in coding.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with other learners and work through our challenges!
- 📫 How to reach me: https://www.instagram.com/ayam_yams/
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I just quit my full time job of being a 5th grade teacher and am looking for a career change in hospitality while I learn how to code :)
